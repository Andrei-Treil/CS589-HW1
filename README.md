# Dependencies
- Written in Python 3.9.13
- pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, matplotlib
# Running the Code
- Original file is ```hw1.ipynb```, if you are able running all code cells like this is ideal
- Otherwise, running  ```HW1-Script.py``` in a directory which contains both csv files named: ***house_votes_84.csv*** and ***iris.csv*** will run all the code through Python
  - When running the script, close each graph which pops up in order to continue to the code
